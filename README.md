Aeon offline wallet generator.

These pages generate an Aeon address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create an Aeon wallet without risking the keys.  
  
  Wallet-gen page creates a wallet address, keys, qr code and mnemonics and presents them to you visually. PdfGen puts the same information (except the mnemonic seed) on a printable paper wallet.

Aeon offline wallet generator.

This page generates an Aeon address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create an Aeon wallet without risking the keys.  
 
   This was adapted from the Sumokoin wallet gen, which was adapted from Monero, which was adapted from MyMonero.  This version is me just ripping out enough to make it excusive and simpler/smaller.

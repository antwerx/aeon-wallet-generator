Aeon offline wallet generator.

This page generates an Aeon address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create an Aeon wallet without risking the keys.  
 
   This was adapted from the Sumokoin wallet gen, which was adapted from Monero, which was adapted from MyMonero. Removed much of the code, all of the css, tried to simplify & streamline (like aeon) as much as possible.
